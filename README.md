**AQI Prediction Web Application**

**Overview**

->The AQI (Air Quality Index) Prediction web application predicts the AQI (Air Quality Index) for a selected city based on state-wise data. It provides    users with an interactive form to select a state and a city, and displays the predicted AQI values. Additionally, it allows users to visualize the AQI   values using different types of charts like bar, line, pie, radar, and polar area.

**This application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (Flask or Django), and Chart.js for graphical representation.**

**Features**

->State and City Selection: Users can select a state and corresponding cities from dropdown menus.
->AQI Prediction: After submitting the form, the predicted AQI value for the selected city is displayed.
->Dynamic Chart Types: The user can visualize AQI data using different chart types such as Bar, Line, Pie, Radar, or Polar Area.
->Responsive Design: The layout is mobile-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience on various screen sizes.
->Stylish UI: The app has a sleek, black background theme with transparent forms, providing a modern, visually appealing design.
